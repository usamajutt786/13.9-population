# 13.9-population
In a population, the birth rate and death rate are calculated as follows:   Birth Rate = Number of Births รท Population   Death Rate = Number of Deaths รท Population   For example, in a population of 100,000 that has 8,000 births and 6,000 deaths per year, the birth rate and death rate are:   Birth Rate = 8,000 รท 100,000 = 0.08   Death Rate = 6,000 รท 100,000 = 0.06   Design a  Population  class that stores a population, number of births, and number of deaths for a period of time. Member functions should return the birth rate and death rate. Implement the class in a program.     Input Validation: Do not accept population figures less than 1, or birth or death numbers less than 0.
